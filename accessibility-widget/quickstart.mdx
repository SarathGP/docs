## Overview

Get the Accessibility Widget on your Shopify store in minutes. Follow these steps to install the app, enable the widget, and make it visible on your storefront.

## Install from the Shopify App Store

1. Go to the [Shopify App Store](PLACEHOLDER_URL) and find the web-accessibility app.
2. Click **Add app** to install it on your store.
3. The installation process is the same as for other Shopify apps.

## Approve permissions

During installation, Shopify asks you to approve the permissions the app needs. Review the requested access and click **Install app** to continue.

## Land in the app

After you approve the permissions, you land in the web-accessibility app dashboard.

## Enable the app embed

When you first open the app, you see a notice that the Accessibility Widget is not active.

<img
  src="/assets/enable-widget-notice.png"
  alt="Notice prompting to enable the accessibility widget"
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
/>

Click **Enable widget** to continue.

## Save your theme changes

Clicking **Enable widget** redirects you to the **App embeds** section of your active theme in the Shopify theme editor. The Accessibility Widget app embed is enabled by default.

<img
  src="/assets/app-embed-save.png"
  alt="App embeds section with Accessibility Widget enabled"
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
/>

Click **Save** in the top right to apply the changes.

## Widget visible on storefront

Once you save, the Accessibility Widget appears on your storefront. You can find it in the corner you selected (by default, the bottom-right).
