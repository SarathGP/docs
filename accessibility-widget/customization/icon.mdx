- **Small** — A compact icon for minimal visual impact
- **Medium** — The default size, balanced for most stores
- **Large** — A larger icon for easier visibility

## Shape

Choose from four icon shapes:

1. **Stick figure** — A simple person icon
2. **Accessibility symbol** — A person with outstretched arms (the universal accessibility symbol)
3. **Wheelchair** — The international symbol of access
4. **Wheelchair with arrow** — A dynamic wheelchair symbol

The selected icon is highlighted in the customization panel. Click any icon to change the widget's appearance.
