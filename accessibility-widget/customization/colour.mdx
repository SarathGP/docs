## Overview

Select the colour you want to display the widget in. The colour applies to the widget icon and the expanded panel.

## Colour picker

Use the colour swatch to choose a colour visually. Click the swatch to open the colour picker and select any colour.

## Hex code input

You can also enter a hex code directly in the text field below the colour swatch. For example, `#086D39` displays a green widget. This is useful when you want to match a specific brand colour.

<Tip>
Use your store's primary or accent colour to keep the widget consistent with your branding.
