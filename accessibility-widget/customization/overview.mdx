## Overview

You can customize the Accessibility Widget to match your store's branding and layout. The customization panel lets you change the colour, icon, position, and language of the widget. A live preview updates as you make changes.

## Customization interface

The customization page shows all options on the left and a live preview on the right. You can switch between desktop and mobile views to see how the widget looks on different devices.
