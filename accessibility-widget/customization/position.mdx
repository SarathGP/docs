## Overview

Select the position you want to display the widget in. You can set different positions for desktop and mobile views.

## Desktop and mobile

Use the **Desktop** and **Mobile** tabs to configure the widget position for each device type. The widget can appear in different corners on desktop vs mobile.

## Position grid

The position grid shows four corner options:

- Top-left
- Top-right
- Bottom-left
- Bottom-right

Click the radio button for the corner where you want the widget to appear. The bottom-right is the default position.

## Fine-tune position

Adjust margins to perfectly position your widget. Use the sliders or enter values in the text fields:

- **Vertical (Max 80px)** — Adjust the vertical spacing from the edge of the screen
- **Horizontal (Max 80px)** — Adjust the horizontal spacing from the edge of the screen

These settings help you align the widget with other elements on your storefront or avoid overlapping content.
